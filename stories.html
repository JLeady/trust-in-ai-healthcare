                    <h3>Diagnosis of Potential Skin Cancer</h3>
                    <p>A 20 year old male had a mole on his back for 10+ years that had began to look abnormal. He went to see his GP and they were immmediately refered to Private healthcare in order to expedite the process.
                        The private healthcare provider then used an AI model called DERM, which involes taking up-close images of the mole which the model then analyses for signs of skin cancer. A few days later, he received his results
                        and too his relief, it was confirmed that the mole was benign and not malignant. This was then backed up by a doctor who approved the results. 
                    </p>
                    <p>The man says the positives he takes from this were:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Expedited process, from GP to diagnosis. </li>
                        <li>Results that I can be confident in knowing that they are correct.</li>
                        <li>Peace of mind knowing that these results were confired by a doctor in the end also.</li>
                    </ul>
