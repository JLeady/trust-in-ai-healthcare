                    <h3>Diagnosis of Potential Skin Cancer</h3>
                    <div class="story-content">
                        <p>A 20 year old male had a mole on his back for 10+ years that had began to look abnormal. He went to see his GP and they were immmediately refered to Private healthcare in order to expedite the process.
                        The private healthcare provider then used an AI model called DERM, which involes taking up-close images of the mole which the model then analyses for signs of skin cancer. A few days later, he received his results
                        and too his relief, it was confirmed that the mole was benign and not malignant. This was then backed up by a doctor who approved the results. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The man says the positives he takes from this were:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Expedited process, from GP to diagnosis. </li>
                            <li>Results that I can be confident in knowing that they are correct.</li>
                            <li>Peace of mind knowing that these results were confired by a doctor in the end also.</li>

                    <h3>Teenager Uses AI-Chatbot for Diagnosis</h3>
                    
                    <div class="story-content">
                        <p>
                            In the latter months of 2025, a 17 year old boy in the UK was experiencing worsening symptoms that including weakness and discoloured feet. After an intial GP consultation that turned out to provide a misdiagnosis, he turned to ChatGPT as a last resort. It suggested Guillain-Barre syndrome, which is a rare neurological disorder, and fortunately this turned out to be true.
                            Following this, he and his mother went to A&E, where hospital staff confirmed the diagnosis and provided emergency treatment.
                        </p>
                        <p>This case highlights some very important considerations:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The growing role of AI in how patients are seeking medical information outside clinical settings.</li>
                            <li>The important of getting a final opinion from a medical professional.</li>
                            <li>Concerns around self-diagnosis and the risk of mental health issues that surrounds this.</li>
                            <li>AI is a brilliant tool in getting a second opinion or some advice prior to speaking to a doctor.</li>
                        </ul>
