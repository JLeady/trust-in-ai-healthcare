                <h2>Studies & News Coverage</h2>
                <p>A study carried out by The Health Foundation in July of 2024 produced findings from the public and NHS staff relating to their opinions on the use of AI for Administrative purposes, below shows the results of this.</p>
                <h3>What does this show?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Srong support for its use in both patient care and administrative purposes from NHS staff, not as much as the public however. Potentially implying a lack of knowledge on the subject.</li>
                    <li>Administrative tasks are more preferable for use of AI by both groups. Especially for NHS staff whos high workload is well documented.</li>
                    <li>Administrative tasks have less impact on a persons health therefore it is a good place to begin implementation.</li>
                    <li>What is your opinion on AI in NHS administrative tasks as well as patient care?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>An article by the BBC showcased how researchers created a AI model that can forecast a persons future health. Just like the weather, the technology has learned to pot patterns in peoples medical records to predict risks of 1,231 diseases to be exact. It is being trialed in Denmark with success and it has had the best results predicting diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart attacks and sepsis, all of which are life-threatening. </p>
